Emory University, located near downtown Atlanta, is divided into nine schools and colleges, four of which serve undergraduate and graduate students. Emoryâ€™s graduate programs include the highly ranked Goizueta Business School, School of Law and School of Medicine. First and second-year students are required to live on campus, but a majority of students remain on campus all four years. The Student Programming Council organizes events and performances throughout the year, including from well-known entertainers and musicians. A popular student organization is Volunteer Emory, which oversees community service activities. The Emory Eagles have nearly 20 NCAA Division III varsity teams and are well-known for their successful swimming and diving team. Regardless of whether they participate in varsity athletics, all students are required to take two courses in physical education. Emory also has a thriving Greek community.
